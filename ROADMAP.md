This is the roadmap which I see for the future of this extension -

[] Enable caching at the pipeline level (CI Build).
[] Enable caching at the release level (CI Build).
[] Allow storage of cache artifacts like an Azure Storage account or Amazon S3.
[] Enable caching during CI builds of branches as well.
